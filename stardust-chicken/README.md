# Overview

## Stardust-Chicken
This is an open research platform to tie together TCAM and string matching research into an extensible algorithmic research algorithm reference.
The primary use case is to generate state machines for string matching algorithms and to translate those state machines into TCAM based state machines.
This enables researchers developing hardware implementations to develop test suites to measure performance improvements from a stable baseline.
This also enables the development and testing of algorithms that tie into hardware developers' processes cleanly. 


### Example usage

#### building project
dotnet build -c Release

#### Getting help 
dotnet run

#### Generate a 4-Variable TCAM table from a list of strings
dotnet .\bin\Release\net6.0\Stardust-Chicken.dll gen_tcam_tables 4 .\dataset-Nov-darpa98\top.10.txt -f .\top.10.tcam.csv

#### Simulate a 4-Variable TCAM table from a list of strings on a file.
dotnet .\bin\Release\net6.0\Stardust-Chicken.dll print tcam simulate .\dataset-Nov-darpa98\top.10.txt 4 .\darpa-1998-pcap\00.pcap
